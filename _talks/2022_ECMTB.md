## Abstract

Pesticide application is met with rapid emergence of pesticide resistance: given the time and cost required to develop novel pesticides, it is necessary to optimise the pesticide application procedure to mitigate the rate of resistance emergence. We studied the role 424of geographical distribution of crop and pesticide application on the rise of resistant phenotypes. We first investigated how the size of an area with oilseed rape and pesticide application affects the rise of the resistant phenotype. Using simulations of a model incorporating pollen beetle life history we found a field size that minimises growth of the resistant sub-population. This minimum is not unique to pollen beetle and oilseed rape: a model of haploid pests with diffusive dispersal displayed the same optimum field size with respect to reduced growth of the resistant sub-population. Close inspection revealed that this optimum field size is due to a tradeoff between minimising dispersal during the pesticide-application period and maximising dispersal after pesticide application. Last but not least we used the findings for one isolated field to predict how populations around and between two and more crop regions interact to shape rise of the resistant phenotype.
