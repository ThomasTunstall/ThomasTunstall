## Abstract

We investigate the role of landscape structure on a range expansion with mutation and selection, using a generalised Eden model. In this lattice model, sites are occupied by wild type or mutant, or empty until infected by a neighbouring site. A phase transition between long-term mutant domination of the population front and coexistence has been characterised in a homogeneous environment for slower-growing mutants in the absence of back mutations [Kuhr et al., NJP, 2011].We here investigate the effect of randomly distributed circular patches that can only be invaded by the mutant - reminiscent of pesticide-treated areas that can only be invaded by resistant pests. Our simulations show that at surprisingly low patch density, mutants can dominate even at fitness lower than which is required in a homogeneous environment. Patches bestow a spatial advantage upon the mutants, enlarging mutant domains that can then overlap with downstream patches, leading to a cascade of patch to patch infection by the mutant domain. This argument can be quantified by combining geometrical arguments for domain boundaries with percolation theory.Our results provide an indication for the long-term dynamics of an expanding population frontier in an inhomogeneous medium, under the effects of mutation and selection.
