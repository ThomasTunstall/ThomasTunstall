## Abstract

Combatting pests with pesticides prompts an evolutionary response: the emergence
of resistance to the pesticide. What measures can be taken to suppress the emergence of
resistance while not foregoing the benefits of population control? We here ask whether the
spatial distribution of pesticide can be tuned to minimise the rise of an existing resistant
subpopulation. Existing models of pesticide application typically employ assumptions
which reduce the impact of spatial heterogeneity in the model. Incorporating explicit
spatial considerations gives rise to novel dynamics which are otherwise not present. Here,
we employ a one-dimensional model with pests undergoing diffusive migration, with
pesticide applied temporarily on a sub-region only. We find that an optimal size of this
sub-region exists, which minimises resistance emergence per area protected over a single
generation. We supplement numerical solutions with analytical bounds for the location of
the optimum, providing insight into the emergence of this optimum. Moving beyond an
isolated area protected by pesticides, we investigate environments consisting of equally
spaced sub-regions where pesticide is applied temporarily. In this case, we demonstrate
that for a given area of pesticide application, there exists an optimum spatial distribution
which minimises the initial rate of resistance emergence. This allows us to answer how a
large agricultural region can be subdivided to optimally suppress resistance emergence.
These findings are a step towards optimised protocols for pesticide application that protect
the crop and suppress the emergence of resistance at the same time.
