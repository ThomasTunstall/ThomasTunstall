## Abstract
Environmental heterogeneity can drive genetic heterogeneity in expanding populations; mutant strains may emerge that trade overall growth rate for an improved ability to survive in patches that are hostile to the wild type. This evolutionary dynamic is of practical importance when seeking to prevent the emergence of damaging traits. We show that a subcritical slow-spreading mutant can attain dominance even when the density of patches is below their percolation threshold and predict this transition using geometrical arguments. This work demonstrates a phenomenon of “assisted percolation”, where one subcritical process assists another to achieve supercriticality.

## Short Summary
The Eden model is a surface growth model which has been used to model bacterial growth across agar plates. Previous work has focussed on implementing selection and mutation into the Eden model, and other work has focussed on seeing how obstacles perturb the histoties of genetic lineage. We combine these two ideas: how is the evolution of a range-expanding population affected by the mutation of wild-type into slower spreading mutants, which are in turn able to invade patches which act as obstacles to the wild-type? In both random and structured environments, we demonstrate that simple geometrical and statistical arguments can accurately predict the phase diagram regarding whether mutants will dominate the population frontier.

This work was undertaken initially to model how pesticide ought to be applied on the geographical scale to be more resistant to mutants in an expanding pest population. The framing was changed when we realised that we have essentially captured a model in which there are two subcritical processes (mutation-selection balance and void percolation) which work together to push the system into a supercritcal (mutant-dominating) state - we term this 'assisted percolation' and feel it will be of interest to the broader physics community.
