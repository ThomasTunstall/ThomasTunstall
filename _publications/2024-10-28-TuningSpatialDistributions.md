## Abstract 
Control measures such as insecticides or antimicrobials are used to contain biological agents such as pathogenic bacteria and vectors of human and plant diseases, respectively. Following control measure application, a resistant subpopulation may eventually rise to such frequency that the control measure will be rendered ineffective: The timescale over which this occurs is the ‘effective lifetime’ of the control measure. Prolonging this timescale relaxes urgency at which novel control measure needs to be developed. Spatial heterogeneity in control measure application can influence the rate at which resistance to the control measure evolves; in the agricultural context, this fact is exploited by distributing insecticides in mosaics across cropping regions in order to slow the rate of resistance evolution.

Contemporary and historical modeling practices, which aim to inform agricultural practices, often employ assumptions which squeeze out the impact of the spatio-temporal heterogeneity endemic to nature. In this paper, we present a minimal model of continuous dispersal and spatio-temporal heterogeneity in selection pressure distribution which exhibits a novel dynamic: The spatial distribution of selection pressure may be tuned in order to minimize the initial rate at which resistance evolves, thus increasing the effective lifetime of a pesticide.
