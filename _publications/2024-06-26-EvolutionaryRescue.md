## Abstract
Evolutionary rescue occurs when the genetic evolution of adaptation saves a population from decline or extinction after environmental change. The evolution of resistance to pesticides is a special scenario of abrupt environmental change, where rescue occurs under (very) strong selection for one or a few de novo resistance mutations of large effect. Here, a population genetic model of evolutionary rescue with density-dependent population change is developed, with a focus on deriving results that are important to resistance management. Massive stochastic simulations are used to generate observations, which are accurately predicted using analytical approximations. Key results include the probability density function for the time to resistance and the probability of population extinction. The distribution of resistance times shows a lag period, a narrow peak and a long tail. Surprisingly, the mean time to resistance can increase with the strength of selection because, if a mutation does not occur early on, then its emergence is delayed by the pesticide reducing the population size. The probability of population extinction shows a sharp transition, in that when extinction is possible, it is also highly likely. Consequently, population suppression and (local) eradication can be theoretically achievable goals, as novel strategies to delay resistance evolution.
